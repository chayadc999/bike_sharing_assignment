## Bike Sharing Assignment

#### Problem Statement

A bike-sharing system is a service in which bikes are made available for shared use to individuals on a short term basis for a price or free. Many bike share systems allow people to borrow a bike from a "dock" which is usually computer-controlled wherein the user enters the payment information, and the system unlocks it. This bike can then be returned to another dock belonging to the same system.

A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19.

#### Goal

1. Identify which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared bikes
2. How well those variables describe the bike demands
#### Approach

1. Data Exploration
2. Data Visualisation
3. Data Preparation
4. Model building and evaluation
